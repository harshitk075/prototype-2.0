THE WEB AND SPIDERS

In this tech savvy era, automation is the key to making every task easier and faster. We aim to bring the power of automation to the designers as well as they prepare their wireframes for various different websites.

Often, despite the efforts of the developer, the vision of the designer is not portrayed on the face of the app/website due to some shortcomings or maybe the workflow of a designer meybe hindered due to the unavailability of a developer. This is where our webapp comes in play.

We have tried to automate the process of generation of webpages based upon the sketches and designs prepared by the designer. This not only aids the designer in expanding their horizons but also is an important tool for web and app developers as the process of frontend development potentially becomes a less of a hassle.
